# AI/ML Object Detection using YOLOv8
YOLOv8 deep learning model for real-time object detection in computer vision applications. YOLOv8 is widely used in industries such as robotics, autonomous driving, and video surveillance.

## Description
In this demonstration, I will use YOLOv8 to detect the objects in a ".jpg" and ".avi" files and out put results as demonstrated below:
